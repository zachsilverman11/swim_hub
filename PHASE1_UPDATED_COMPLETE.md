---

## Key Features Implemented

### Real Data Integration

**Connected Collections**:
- ✅ `locations` (18 active locations across BC & Alberta)
- ✅ `seasons` (Fall #2 2025, Winter 2026)
- ✅ `programs` (availability windows per location/season)
- ✅ `bookings` (273 bookings for Fall #2)
- ✅ `lessons` (2,070 individual lessons)
- ✅ `pricing` (30/45/60 min pricing, private & group)

### Weekly Utilization Calculation

**How it works**:
1. **Available Hours/Week**: Calculated from `programs` collection
   - Each program defines a time window (e.g., "Monday 15:00-21:00")
   - Summed across all programs at that location

2. **Booked Hours/Week**: Calculated from `bookings` collection
   - Each booking = ONE weekly recurring time slot
   - Duration calculated from startTime/endTime
   - Only confirmed bookings counted

3. **Utilization Rate**: `Booked / Available`

**Current Results** (Fall #2 2025):
- Overall utilization: **57.5%**
- Top location: Como Lake (Coquitlam) at **90.9%**
- 9 locations under 40% (need attention)

### Revenue Analytics

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Total revenue: **$139,975.50** (Fall #2)
- Average booking value: **$512.73**
- Revenue by location
- Revenue by lesson type (30/45/60 min)
- Revenue by format (private/group)

**Top Locations by Revenue** (Fall #2):
1. Como Lake (Coquitlam): $25,777.50
2. Coquitlam: $24,780.00

## Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Types

All types match your actual Firebase schema:
- `Location` - with address object, region, facilities
- `Season` - with registration dates, hold-my-spot dates
- `Program` - availability windows by day of week
- `Booking` - complete booking with payment info
- `Lesson` - individual lesson instances
- `Pricing` - private and small group pricing
- `WeeklyUtilization` - calculated utilization metrics
- `LocationInsights`, `SeasonInsights`, `BusinessSnapshot` - analytics

### Firebase Integration

- **Read-only**: No write operations, safe to run alongside booking platform
- **Real-time**: Always fetches current data from Firebase
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with exported types
- **Flexible**: Filter by location, season, date range

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Weekly Utilization**: Based on recurring bookings, not individual lessons
2. **Revenue from Bookings**: Use bookings collection (packages/sets), not individual lessons
3. **Available Hours from Programs**: Programs define when coaching is available
4. **Season-based Filtering**: All insights filtered by active seasons

## How to Use

### Basic Example

```typescript

const seasons = await businessIntelligence.getSeasons(true);
const fallSeason = seasons.find(s => s.name.includes('Fall'));

// Get business snapshot
const snapshot = await businessIntelligence.getBusinessSnapshot(fallSeason.id);

console.log(`Total Revenue: $${snapshot.totalRevenue.toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`Overall Utilization: ${(snapshot.overallUtilization * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);

// Find underperforming locations
snapshot.underperformingLocations.forEach(loc => {
  console.log(`⚠️ ${loc.location.name}: ${(loc.utilization.utilizationRate * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
});
```

### Location-Specific Analysis

```typescript
// Get insights for a specific location
const insights = await businessIntelligence.getLocationInsights(
  'coquitlam-como-lake',
  '8RvkMVwUbfNn9CGBUmxX' // Fall #2 2025
);

console.log(`Location: ${insights.location.name}`);
console.log(`Available: ${insights.utilization.availableHoursPerWeek}h/week`);
console.log(`Booked: ${insights.utilization.bookedHoursPerWeek}h/week`);
console.log(`Utilization: ${(insights.utilization.utilizationRate * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Performance: ${insights.performance}`);
console.log(`Revenue: $${insights.revenue.totalRevenue.toFixed(2)}`);
```

## Key Insights from Your Data

### Strengths
- **Strong performers**: Como Lake (90.9%), Langley (86.8%)
- **Good revenue**: $140K for one season
- **Popular lesson type**: 30-min private lessons (174 bookings)

### Opportunities
- **9 locations under 40% utilization** - potential for growth
- **Abbotsford**: 0% utilization - needs investigation
- **Group lessons**: Only 15 bookings vs 258 private - untapped market?

### Recommendations
1. Focus marketing on underperforming locations
2. Investigate why Abbotsford has no bookings
3. Consider promoting group lessons (lower price per swimmer)
4. Replicate success of Como Lake and Langley to other locations
